# Part 1: Data Analysis and Insight
## Data Overview
The dataset contains information on 201 shoe products, with key attributes such as brand, color, size, and price. It includes 25 different brands, ranging from internationally recognized names like Adidas, Nike, Converse, PUMA, and Reebok to more regional or fashion-focused brands such as Franco Leone, Tresmode, Hush Puppies, and Liberty. This diversity provides a broad overview of the footwear market, reflecting a range of styles, price levels, and target consumers. Regarding descriptive statistics, the average shoe price falls within a mid-range level, and the standard deviation indicates a moderate variation in prices. The lowest recorded prices are mostly associated with brands like Tresmode, Liberty, and Camel, which focus on affordable or basic footwear options. On the other hand, the highest prices are recorded by brands such as Franco Leone, Crocs, and Tresmode (specifically for certain color variants), which tend to offer more premium designs or limited-edition styles. The median price shows that half of the shoes fall below a practical price point, highlighting that most products are aimed at average consumers, while still leaving room for both budget and high-end choices in the market.

## Descriptive Statistics
# Insight 1: Which three brands contribute the most to the total shoe price, and what does this indicate about their market presence?
The chart titled “Total Price Contribution by Brand” illustrates the dominance of certain brands in terms of total sales value within the dataset. Crocs emerges as the clear leader, contributing a total of 15,045, which is significantly higher than any other brand. This suggests that Crocs either offers a wide range of products, commands higher price points, or both—making it a key revenue driver in the market. Following Crocs, Franco Leone and Tresmode rank as the second and third top contributors, with total price contributions of 5,597 and 5,415, respectively. Although their figures are substantially lower than Crocs, they still represent strong brand performance relative to other competitors. Overall, the data highlights a notable imbalance in revenue distribution, with a few brands accounting for the majority of the total value, which could influence future business decisions such as stock prioritization or promotional focus.

# Insight 2: How does the total price contribution of Crocs compare to Franco Leone and Tresmode, and what could be the possible reasons behind this difference?
By analyzing the "Average Shoe Price by Color and Brand" chart, we can observe that each brand emphasizes specific colors that are both frequently sold and strategically priced. Crocs features Orange as the most sold color with a relatively high average price, suggesting it is both a popular and premium product offering. Franco Leone records the highest sales in Black & Red, a color combination that also holds one of the highest average prices across all brands, indicating a deliberate branding effort towards bold, standout styles. For Tresmode, Silver stands out as the best-selling and one of the most expensive colors, reinforcing its positioning in the more stylish or formal segment. These trends show how each brand leverages color preferences to balance volume and price, potentially influencing inventory and promotional strategies.
