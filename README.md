## Descriptive Statistics
# Insight 1:
Crocs stands out significantly, contributing the highest total price of 15,045, which is nearly three times more than the second-highest, Franco Leone (5,597). This dominance suggests that Crocs not only has a high volume of sales or premium pricing but may also be the most popular or widely stocked brand in the dataset. Most other brands contribute relatively small amounts to the total, indicating a highly skewed distribution of sales value among brands. This implies a potential concentration risk in relying heavily on one or two top-performing brands; businesses should consider diversifying offerings or investing in marketing for underperforming brands like Toms, Umbro, and Vanilla Moon to balance revenue streams.

# Insight 2:
The brand Hidesign has the highest average shoe size at over 12, which is significantly above the dataset’s overall average. This suggests Hidesign may cater to customers with larger shoe sizes, possibly targeting a niche or specific demographic, such as men or international markets. In contrast, brands like Tresmode, Lavie, and Vanilla Moon show the lowest average sizes, around 5 to 6, implying these brands likely focus on smaller sizes—potentially indicating a primary female target audience. This variation in size averages reveals brand-level specialization that can help inform product positioning and marketing strategies.
